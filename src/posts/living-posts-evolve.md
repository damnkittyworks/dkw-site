Living Posts are designed to change over time in public.

Each revision captures a small step forward so the post reflects what is true now,
not just what was true on day one.

This also means readers can scan the changelog and quickly see what changed
without rereading the entire essay.

In v1, each changelog entry links straight to the underlying git commit for full context.
