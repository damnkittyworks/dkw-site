  <h1>About Damn Kitty Works</h1>
  <p>
    DKW exists because I got tired of waiting for someone to fix the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    The gap between people who can use AI and people who can't is growing fast.
    On one side: builders shipping tools and automations every day. On the other:
    everyone else, watching it happen, feeling left behind. That gap leads somewhere ugly.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm not a programmer. I'm the person who pulls the thread until the whole thing unravels,
    then explains it so anyone can follow. No CS degree. Just a need to understand how things
    work and a habit of making them make sense for everyone else.
  </p>
  <p>
    Damn Kitty Works is where I build in public. Every tool, every project, every mistake -
    documented and transparent. If I can figure this out, you can figure this out.
    That's not motivational fluff. That's the whole thesis.

  <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
  <p><strong>Agency over advocacy.</strong> Protests ask others to change. Building changes yourself.</p>
  <p><strong>Normie-first, always.</strong> If the instructions need a CS degree, the instructions are wrong.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Show the messy parts.</strong> Every post on this site evolves. You can see my edits,
    my corrections, my "oh wait, I was totally wrong about that." That's not a bug, that's the product.
